# DEVELOPMENT GUIDE

## Release -> Commits
We decided to use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for our commits. This means that every commit should have a type, a scope and a message.
We need to follow in order to automate the release process. You can check
the examples of our dependency to automate this [here](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release#commit-message-format).
